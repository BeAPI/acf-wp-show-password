# ACF WP Show Password #

Very simple WordPress plugin to add a checkbox show password when it's an ACF input type password

1. Works both for ACF and WP or only WP
2. Won't break if ACF is not installed 
3. Add your field type password to your acf group field
4. That's it ! The login screen WP and filed type password ACF will get show/hide checkbox :)

## Override HTML markup

There's a WP filter for that but make sure you keep IDs and class for inputs. Otherwise js won't work.
